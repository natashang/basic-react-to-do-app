# basic-react-to-do-app
A small application consisting of a To Do Form built with two different implementations: 

1. Class component with props passed down from the parent component
2. Functional component using the ```useState``` hook

Users can enter any input into the input field and click the "add" button to view the updated list of tasks. Clicking the "X" button deletes the task from the list.

This application is deployed via ```gh-pages``` and can be viewed [here](https://natashang.github.io/basic-react-to-do-app/)
